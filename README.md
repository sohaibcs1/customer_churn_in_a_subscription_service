# customer_churn_in_a_subscription_service
Project Requirements:

Objective: Develop a predictive model to identify customer churn in a subscription service.
Data Source: Utilize a dataset containing information about customer interactions with the subscription service, including relevant columns such as:
Customer ID
Event type (e.g., purchase, interaction)
Timestamp of each event
Other relevant demographic or transactional data if available
Churn Definition: Define churn based on a period of inactivity. For example:
If a customer hasn't interacted with the service (e.g., made a purchase) for a certain duration, they are considered churned.
Define the threshold for inactivity based on business needs and dataset characteristics.
Feature Engineering:
Explore and identify relevant features that may indicate customer churn, such as:
Frequency of interactions
Recency of interactions
Customer demographics (if available)
Transaction history (if available)
Consider incorporating additional external data if it enhances prediction accuracy.
Model Selection:
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for churn prediction, such as:
Cox Proportional Hazards model
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines
Experiment with different models and evaluate their performance using suitable metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC).
Evaluation Metrics: Define evaluation metrics to assess model performance, considering the imbalance between churn and non-churn instances. Possible metrics include:
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC)
Model Deployment: After selecting the best-performing model, deploy it into a production environment for real-time churn prediction. Consider factors such as scalability, latency, and maintenance.
Documentation and Reporting:
Document the entire process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
Prepare a comprehensive report outlining key findings, insights, and recommendations for reducing churn.
Communicate results to stakeholders effectively, highlighting actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.
Iterative Improvement:
Continuously monitor model performance in production and incorporate feedback for iterative improvement.
Regularly update the model using new data to adapt to changing customer behavior patterns.
Ethical Considerations: Ensure ethical use of customer data and transparency in model deployment and decision-making processes. Protect customer privacy and comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
